  title: SubscriptionStatus
  description: |
    This API allows users to obtain the current subscription status of a phone number, including Voice/SMS inbound, Voice/SMS outbound, and data service status. 

    # Introduction
    
    This API obtains the business subscription status of a phone number by passing it in, including Voice/SMS inbound, Voice/SMS outbound, and data service status.

    Normally, the business subscription status is active, and the following situations may lead to abnormal business subscription status.

    **Overdue fees and downtime**: If the account balance is insufficient or the monthly rental fee is not paid on time, the operator may suspend the service.

    **Real name authentication issue**: If identity information is not updated in a timely manner (such as expired documents or incomplete second real name authentication), the operator may freeze the account.

    **Violation**: Frequent making harassing phone calls, engaging in illegal activities, and other behaviors can lead to service suspension.

    **Abnormal usage behavior**: High frequency outgoing calls, long-distance roaming, sensitive period communication, and other behaviors may be detected by the operator's risk control system, which may lead to service suspension.

    It helps verify whether telecommunication services are active or suspended for fraud prevention, customer support, and operational checks.
    
    **Scenario 1 - Payment System Validation**:
      * A financial service provider uses this API to validate if a user's phone number has active voice/SMS services before processing high-risk transactions. If the API returns "suspended" for Voice/SMS inbound, the transaction is flagged for manual review to prevent fraud or invalid transfers.
    
    **Scenario 2 - Customer Service Troubleshooting**:
      * The user reported that they were unable to receive calls. Customer support queries the API and identifies that "Voice/SMS inbound" is suspended. 
      * The user reported that they were unable to make a phone call. Customer support queries API and confirms that 'voice/SMS outbound' is suspended
      * The user reported that they are unable to use the data service.Customer support queries API and confirms that 'data service status' is suspended
      
        The customer service personnel guides the user to reactivate the service, resolving the issue.
        
    # Relevant terms and definitions
    - **Voice/SMS Inbound**  
      Indicates the ability of the subscriber to **receive** incoming voice calls and SMS messages.  
      - `active`: The subscriber can receive calls and SMS normally.  
      - `suspended`: The subscriber is blocked from receiving calls/SMS (e.g., due to account suspension).

    - **Voice/SMS Outbound**  
      Indicates the ability of the subscriber to **initiate** outgoing voice calls and send SMS messages.  
      - `active`: The subscriber can make calls and send SMS normally.  
      - `suspended`: The subscriber is blocked from initiating calls/SMS (e.g., due to unpaid bills or fraud restrictions).

    - **Data Service Status**  
      Indicates the availability and performance level of mobile data connectivity.  
      - `active`: Full-speed data access is enabled.  
      - `suspended`: Data service is completely disabled (e.g., due to contract expiration).  
      - `throttled`: Data service is available but speed is reduced (e.g., after exceeding usage limits).

    # Identifying the phone number from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a phone number as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` field, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `phoneNumber` field is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same phone number is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.
